# EDA_PROJECT
**Portfolio Project Exploratory Data Analysis**

EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is a data analysis approach that focuses on summarizing and visualizing the main characteristics of a dataset.
This project is a task from Dibimbing.id
In this project, I'm using dataset from kaggle.com about Student Admission Record by Zeeshan Ahmad. 
I'm using the dataset from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeeshier/student-admission-records

This Student Admission record includes name, age, test scores, high school percentage, city of origin, and admission status.

This analysis is useful for facilitating the new student admission committee, the school, students, and parents.

**Goals**
1. Minimum score required for admission as a new student
2. Cities with the highest number of applicants
3. Cities with the highest percentage of accepted applicants
4. Results of accepted students 

**Tools**
1. Excel
